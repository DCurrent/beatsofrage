
	== BOR SOURCE V1.0029 (30 jan 2004) ==

This package contains the source code for Beats of Rage (DOS),
written by Senile Team (http://www.senileteam.com/).

The code was last edited 30 January 2004.

It was written for use with a Watcom compiler for DOS/4GW or PmodeW.

It was not written with publication in mind, so there is little
documentation, if any, to go with the code. But in view of the game's
popularity, and the numerous requests to release the source code, we
figured, "what the hell".



	== THIS IS A RE-RELEASE ==

This is a re-release of the original Beats of Rage source code.
This re-release is dated 22 August 2013, and contains the exact
same source code as the original 2004 release. It is purely intended
for people with an interest in the history of the Beats of Rage
engine.

This release contains all C and ASM code specific to Beats of Rage.
It does not include any installation or compilation instructions.
It does not include any images, sounds, level data or tools to create
your own version of the game. You can obtain such data elsewhere on
the net.

Please note that Senile Team has at the time of this writing withdrawn
from further development of the Beats of Rage engine. However, the open
source project called OpenBOR is still very much alive.
